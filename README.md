## Mission Purpose
Project CITADEL is a **mini cyber range** purpose-built for training, simulation, and demonstration of cyber warfare operations.  
It provides a contained environment to **emulate adversary tactics**, **defend critical systems**, and **accelerate operator readiness** through hands-on scenarios.  

Designed as a **portable, modular range**, CITADEL empowers individuals and teams to sharpen offensive and defensive skills without requiring enterprise-scale infrastructure.

## Key Features
- **Adversary Emulation**  
  Red Team environments simulating Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) techniques.  

- **Defensive Operations**  
  Blue Team modules with intrusion detection, incident response, and forensics.  

- **Range Scenarios**  
  Configurable attack/defend labs aligned with **MITRE ATT&CK** and **NIST 800-115** guidelines.  

- **AI-Assisted Analysis**  
  Optional AI integration for threat triage, log analysis, and after-action reporting.  

- **Lightweight Deployment**  
  Containerized stack (Docker / Kubernetes) for rapid spin-up on laptops, servers, or cloud instances.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Kubernetes  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) + Celery  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL + ElasticSearch (logs)  
- **Threat Data:** MITRE ATT&CK, CISA KEV, custom APT scenarios  
- **Visualization:** Kibana + Grafana dashboards  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI / LLaMA models for automated threat summaries  

---

## Example Training Scenarios
- **Red vs Blue Exercise**: Simulated spear-phishing campaign followed by log analysis and remediation.  
- **APT Hunt**: Emulation of persistence techniques with endpoint detection and live response.  
- **Satellite Comms Defense**: Space-ops relevant scenario with SATCOM intrusion detection.  
- **Forensics Drill**: Incident response with packet capture, malware reverse engineering, and report generation.
